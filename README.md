# DAY-testnet-faucet [WIP]
### Faucet for Chronologic's DAY tokens on the Testnet

How to deploy the testnet faucet locally:
- `npm install -g truffle`
- `truffle compile`
- `truffle migrate`

After deployment it generates a file called `DAY_contracts.json` with the addresses of the deployed contracts.

Tested with:
- Truffle v4.0.4
